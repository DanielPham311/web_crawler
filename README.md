# This is a web crawler application carried out to test understandings of HTTP
## The purpose of the application is to crawl a website and produce a report of the internal linking structure of the website
The application can be run using the following command:
<code><b>npm run {website URL}</b></code>
<br></br>

This program will practically crawl the websites and log out a report in the console (maybe made to produce a file in the future we'll see) of all the internal links inside the HTML document and the number of times it was hit ðŸ˜„
